This repo contains a bunch of files related to hacking games on the NES. Much of it comes
from my work (2nd half) of a co-presentation I did for HOPE 2020 (Hackers on Planet Earth)
hacker conference (normally held in New York, but given the COVID pandemic, was entirely
online).

Many of these files may be disorganized or appear to contain random blocks of text. It's
because a lot of these documents were never intended from the start to be made
available to the public (given how raw and crude they are). However, in an effort to
share knowledge and hoping that it may help someone, I'm releasing them. I may
update them at -some- point to be better organized and refined but for now, they're
available as is.

That said, many of the random blocks of text are my immediate thoughts (thoughts that I
didn't want to lose) as they may help me in the future hone in on answering a question I
had about that particular piece or component I was working on at the time.
